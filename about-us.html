      <h1 class="text-base font-bold text-indigo-600 tracking-wide uppercase"> When you solve a puzzle </h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> When you solve a puzzle, your brain is actively engaged in
        problem-solving and decision-making. This process involves several areas of the brain, including the prefrontal
        cortex, which is responsible for planning and decision-making, and the temporal lobes, which are involved in
        memory and perception. As you work on a puzzle, your brain is constantly processing and integrating information
        from your senses, as well as recalling and using stored information from your memory. This process of actively
        thinking and problem-solving can be mentally stimulating and can help to keep your brain active and healthy.
        Solving puzzles can also activate the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which are
        associated with feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. This can contribute to the feeling of accomplishment and
        enjoyment that many people experience when they solve a puzzle. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-base font-bold text-indigo-600 tracking-wide uppercase"> Excess Screen Time Affect </h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> There are a number of potential problems that children and adolescents
        may face as a result of excessive screen time. These can include physical problems such as eyestrain, neck and
        back pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as more psychological issues such as sleep disturbances,
        difficulty with social interactions, and problems with attention and concentration. Children who spend a lot of
        time in front of screens may also be at risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, and
        other mental health disorders. Additionally, children who spend a lot of time on screens may be at risk for
        developing unhealthy habits such as snacking while using screens, sedentary behavior, and a lack of physical
        activity. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-base font-bold text-indigo-600 tracking-wide uppercase"> What is STEAM </h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> STEAM toys are educational toys that are designed to engage children in
        activities that promote learning in the fields of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics
        (STEM/STEAM). These toys often take the form of puzzles or games that require children to use critical thinking
        and problem-solving skills to complete. Puzzle STEAM toys may involve building, constructing, or creating
        something, and can help children develop skills such as spatial awareness, fine motor skills, and
        problem-solving abilities. They may also expose children to concepts in STEM/STEAM fields and can help spark an
        interest in these subjects at an early age. Many puzzle STEAM toys are designed to be hands-on and interactive,
        making them an engaging and fun way for children to learn. </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> Welcome to The IQ Box, our puzzle subscription company! We are a team
        of puzzle enthusiasts who are passionate about providing a high-quality puzzle-solving experience for people of
        all ages and skill levels. Our company was founded on the belief that puzzles have the power to bring people
        together. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-base font-bold text-indigo-600 tracking-wide uppercase"> Our Mission </h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> Our mission is to provide a unique and engaging puzzle-solving
        experience for people of all ages and skill levels. By offering a wide variety of puzzles and constantly
        updating our selection, we strive to challenge and entertain our subscribers while also helping them exercise
        their brains and improve their problem-solving skills. We are committed to providing excellent customer service
        and making puzzle-solving accessible and enjoyable for everyone. The IQ Box started when we noticed we(more
        specifically kids) are spending a lot on useless activities and the overall IQ development is not happening. Our
        screen time has seen an increasing because of Multiple Cartoon Channel, Mobile phones usage, Gaming, YouTube,
        Social Media, Binge watching on OTT and many more. Our IQ level is also coming down because people dont tend to
        remember things, they can either do google search or ask there favourite voice assistant like
        Google/Alexa/Siri.There are advantages to it but at the same time kids are not building memory muscles and
        neuron connections. The IQ Box is an attempt to declutter from all these acivities and focus our brain to solve
        some challenging puzzles. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-base font-bold text-indigo-600 tracking-wide uppercase"> When you solve a puzzle </h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> When you solve a puzzle, your brain is actively engaged in
        problem-solving and decision-making. This process involves several areas of the brain, including the prefrontal
        cortex, which is responsible for planning and decision-making, and the temporal lobes, which are involved in
        memory and perception. As you work on a puzzle, your brain is constantly processing and integrating information
        from your senses, as well as recalling and using stored information from your memory. This process of actively
        thinking and problem-solving can be mentally stimulating and can help to keep your brain active and healthy.
        Solving puzzles can also activate the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which are
        associated with feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. This can contribute to the feeling of accomplishment and
        enjoyment that many people experience when they solve a puzzle. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-base font-bold text-indigo-600 tracking-wide uppercase"> Excess Screen Time Affect </h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> There are a number of potential problems that children and adolescents
        may face as a result of excessive screen time. These can include physical problems such as eyestrain, neck and
        back pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as more psychological issues such as sleep disturbances,
        difficulty with social interactions, and problems with attention and concentration. Children who spend a lot of
        time in front of screens may also be at risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, and
        other mental health disorders. Additionally, children who spend a lot of time on screens may be at risk for
        developing unhealthy habits such as snacking while using screens, sedentary behavior, and a lack of physical
        activity. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-base font-bold text-indigo-600 tracking-wide uppercase"> What is STEAM </h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> STEAM toys are educational toys that are designed to engage children in
        activities that promote learning in the fields of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics
        (STEM/STEAM). These toys often take the form of puzzles or games that require children to use critical thinking
        and problem-solving skills to complete. Puzzle STEAM toys may involve building, constructing, or creating
        something, and can help children develop skills such as spatial awareness, fine motor skills, and
        problem-solving abilities. They may also expose children to concepts in STEM/STEAM fields and can help spark an
        interest in these subjects at an early age. Many puzzle STEAM toys are designed to be hands-on and interactive,
        making them an engaging and fun way for children to learn. </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 class="text-base font-bold text-indigo-600 tracking-wide uppercase"> How We Select a Puzzle </h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 md:pr-16"> Level of difficulty: The difficulty level of a puzzle can be an
        important factor in determining its appeal and replay value. A puzzle that is too easy may not be satisfying to
        solve, while a puzzle that is too difficult may be frustrating. Originality and creativity: A puzzle that is
        unique and creative can be more engaging and enjoyable to solve. Clarity and fairness: A puzzle should be clear
        and fair, with all of the necessary information provided and no hidden tricks or unfair elements. Quality of
        materials: The quality of the materials used in a puzzle, such as the paper, ink, or plastic, can affect the
        overall experience of solving the puzzle. Length of time to solve: The length of time it takes to solve a puzzle
        can be a factor in its enjoyment, as a puzzle that is too short may not be satisfying, while a puzzle that is
        too long may be frustrating. Replay value: A puzzle that can be solved multiple times without losing its appeal
        can be more satisfying to solve. Thematic appeal: A puzzle with a theme that is interesting or appealing to the
        solver can enhance the enjoyment of the puzzle. Ease of storage: A puzzle that is easy to store and transport
        can be more convenient to work on and can encourage more frequent solving. </p>
